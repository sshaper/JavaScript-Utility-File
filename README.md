# JavaScript-Utility-File
This is a utility file I created that handles some of the common JavaScript functions.  Many similar are out there this one is just custom for me.

# Util.checkElementAddListener
This method checks that the element exists first then adds an event listener to that element.
Takes three arguments (elementId, event, func)
* elementId = The id of the element we are adding the event listener too.
* event = The actual event we are adding 'click', 'mouseover', 'change', etc.
* funct = The function we are going to call when the event occurs (can be an anonymous function)

# Util.checkElementRemoveLitener
This method checks that the element exists first then removes the event listener
Takes three arguments (elementId, event, func)
* elementId = The id of the element we are adding the event listener too.
* event = The actual event we are adding 'click', 'mouseover', 'change', etc.
* funct = The function we are going to call when the event occurs (can be an anonymous function)
